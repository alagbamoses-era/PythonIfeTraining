#Problem 1
#If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

#Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

  NumList = []
  while i < n: #while the current number is less than n.
    if (i%3)==0 or (i%5) == 0: #Check if i is divisible by 3 or 5
      NumList.append(i) #append the number to our list.
    else:
      pass
    i+= 1 #increment by i until it is equal to n.
  return sum(NumList) #return the sum of list.

#Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
#1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

#By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Two functions
## function 1 is fibonacci: This function finds the whole list of numbers with values less than n.
## sumEvenValue: This is function 2, this finds the sum of all numbers in the list that is divisible by 2.

   SequenceList.append(c) #append the sum of the last 2 numbers.
   if c >n: #if the last number added is greater than n, break
